# CustomGento Magento Extensions Documentation

https://docs.customgento.com

## How to Work on this Documentation (these commands do not work with fish, use bash to run them instead)

1. You need to have Jekyll installed. To install it, follow instructions
   on https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Open your terminal and navigate to your project (see instructions
   on https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/#option2).
    - When you need to update your dependencies run `bundle update`.
    - Otherwise, run `bundle install` instead (update would be recommended though).
4. Build the site with `bundle exec jekyll serve`
5. The site should now run locally at https://localhost:4000/.
